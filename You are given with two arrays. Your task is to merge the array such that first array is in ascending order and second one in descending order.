You are given with two arrays. Your task is to merge the array such that first array is in ascending order and second one in descending order.

Input Description:
First line contains two integer ‘n’ and ‘m’. ‘n’ denotes length of array 1 and ‘m’ of array 2.Next line contains n space separated numbers and third line contains ‘m’ space separated numbers

Output Description:
Print a single array in desired order

Sample Input :
3 3
23 15 16
357 65 10
Sample Output :
15 16 23 357 65 10

CODE:

def out1(a):
    return sorted(a)

def out2(a):
    return sorted(a, reverse = True)

n, m = map(int, input().split())
x1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
x2 = list(map(int, input().split()))

final = [out1(x1) + out2(x2)]
print(*final[0])
